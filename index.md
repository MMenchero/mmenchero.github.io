## Welcome! 
My name is Mariana and I'm a supply chain scientist in MÃ©xico City. I currently work as a senior forecaster at a consulting company that works with large retailers. At this company, I developed a forecasting system that creates weekly forecasts for thousands of time series at SKU-store level. I'm part of the Data Science Team, so I'm constantly researching and trying out new forecasting methods. 

I've been working on demand forecasting for over two and a half years, and I've have learned a lot in that time. However, there is still a lot for me to learn, not just about forecasting, but also about other aspects of the supply chain, like inventory optimization. Hence, I decided to create this site to keep a well-organized record of everything I learn. 

In a way, this site is like my personal notebook. I just made it public because it might help other supply chain scientists or people with an interest in demand forecasting. Unlike other areas of Data Science, like Computer Vision or NLP, I think that Time Series Forecasting is still in its early stages of development. The latest M-Competition (M5) helped advanced the field. And sure, the code of some of the winning solutions can be found on Kaggle, but a detailed description of how and why the winning methods work maybe be harder to find. 

There are several packages in R and Python that let you create a forecast very quickly and without knowing what is really happening behind the scenes. Yet I believe that a *professional* supply chain scientist must have a good understanding of the forecasting methods that he or she is using. And he or she must also know which metrics to use - or not to use. Hence, I think the whole field is hard, at least when done right. It requires a good knowledge of multiple things, like computer science, statistics, probability and domain knowledge (i.e. knowledge about the business we're generating a forecast for). So, these notes and comments are my attempt at becoming a better *professional* supply chain scientist, and hopefully they help other people going through the same journey too.
